This is a weather app walkthrough from a course I took, 'Accelerated ES6 JavaScript Training' by instructor Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

I changed some names because I didn't like everything in caps except for one file.

Additionally, I converted some functions to arrow functions where possible, as it was inconsistent with the class's purpose to not use ES6 features.

I would have used the built-in fetch() function, but I thought it would be good to get some exposure to XML. Though fetch is a ES6 feature, so not sure why it was in there, but I have penty of work using it.
